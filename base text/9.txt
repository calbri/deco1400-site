You pilot the Seeker through the rounded entrance
to the grotto. Once inside, your searchlight
picks up what appear to be docks and piers along
the grotto walls. The Seeker's searchlight is not
very powerful. However, you do have a special
laser light which would light up the grotto like
daylight. Unfortunately, the laser light can only be
used twice for very short periods before it must be
recharged aboard the Maray, now more than
2,000 feet above you on the surface.
