The radio transmissions seem to be failing, and
you grow tired of sending signals through the
closed door. You are just about to give up when
the door suddenly swings open revealing behind it
a cavern with another door. You enter the cavern
cautiously and receive a radio signal in English. It
tells you that you are welcome here, but that once
you enter this place, you may never return to the
world above. It is up to you to decide.
