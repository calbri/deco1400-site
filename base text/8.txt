Carefully, you maneuver the Seeker between
the walls of the canyon.

On the floor of the canyon, you discover a large
round hole out of which flow the large bubbles.
The Seeker is equipped with scientific equipment
to analyze the bubbles. It also has sonar equipment
that can measure the depth of any hole.
