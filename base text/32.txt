With great sorrow, you decide that it is wisest to
leave the expedition now. You can't risk returning
to the great depths below. So, you reluctantly
return to the United States.

You are invited to tell of your adventures on
several major television shows. While on one such
show, a special news flash announces to the world
the discovery of Atlantis. You regret your decision,
but you didn't really have a choice. Did you?

The End
