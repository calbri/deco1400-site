            <p>Moving cautiously, you climb up the sides of the
            canyon hoping to reach the ocean floor. You leave
            the Seeker in the grips of the giant squid. Your plan
            is to signal for help with a dye marker that will float
            to the surface and make a bright yellow patch in
            the water. The crewmen above have been instructed
            to watch for such emergency signals.
                They will send help.</p>

            <p>Once you reach the ledge above the canyon
            and feel slightiy safer, you see the most feared of all
            sea creaturesâ€” a huge shark. It begins to circle
            towards you and you know that you are its target.
            You wonder whether you should fire your
            emergency propulsion charge that will send you
            rapidly to the surface. The shark is fast; he might
            catch you anyway. You also know that you will get
            the bends from the rapid rise to the surface.</p>
