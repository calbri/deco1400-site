            <p>You radio a status report to the Moray and tell
            them that you are going to cast off from the line
            and descend under your own power. Your plan is
            approved and you cast off your line. Now you are
            on your own. The Seeker slips noiselessly into the
                undersea canyon.</p>

            <p>As you drop into the canyon, you turn on the
            Seeker's powerful searchlight. Straight ahead is a
            dark wall covered with a strange type of barnacle
            growth. To the left (port) side you see what appears
            to be a grotto. The entrance is perfectly
            round, as if it had been cut by human hands.
            Lantern fish give off a pale, greenish light. To the
            right (starboard) side of the Seeker you see bubbles
            rising steadily from the floor of the canyon.</p>
